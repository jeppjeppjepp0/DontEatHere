## Description 

The motivation behind this project was to create a webpage that would inform people of the best times to see the sunrises and sunsets. Included in the page was also the sunrise and sunset of the Summer Solstice. Within the webpage, users can search up any city and will receive the exact time at which the sunrises and sets as well the total length of day for the current day and the Summer Solstice.

## Usage 

The page we created is a very user friendly page that is easy to navigate through and take you straight to the results. Users will go to the site and type in whateer city they'd like, it could be one within their neighborhood or one across the country, and the will immediately receive the exact time for both the current day and the Summer Solstice.
